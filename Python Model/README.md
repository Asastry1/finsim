# File Structure
| File Name  | Description   |
|---|---|
|explorationModel.py   | Functions and some assumptions to simulate costs of oil exploration |
|productionModel.py   | Functions and some assumptions to simulate the costs of production, as well as crude oil output  |
|oilForecast.py   | Forecasted time series of crude oil spot prices (WTI)  |
|simulation.py   |Monte Carlo simulation drawing on the other 3 files' functions and assumption   |

# Current Status
** Exploration Model **
- Complete with naive assumptions
- Forecast of drilling depths could use further rigor

** Production Model **
- Research complete on models and assumptions

** WTI Forecast **
- Research complete on models and assumptions

** Simulation **
- Updated with *Exploration Model*
- Could use some parameterization and more specific functions going foward
