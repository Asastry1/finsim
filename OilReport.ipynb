    "Costs for on-shore seismic methods are estimated to be between \\$8,000 and $50,000 per square kilometer depending on the terrain and the quality of method used to perform the scanning operation. In the case of Texas, the flat land and low-risk environment suggests a cost on the lower end of the range. As this price derives its value from a number of underlying factors such as manpower, movement and lease of equipment, number of days required, a triangular distribution was chosen. An additional \\$500 per kilometer was added to include the cost of processing. Finally, a second triangular distribution for the analysis of the data was added. This distribution was once again chosen as the cost of the analsysis is based on the terrain, equipment used, and challenge of interpretation. The stated range of \\$100,000 - \\$1,000,000 includes values from the most simple output, to the most challenging. As Texas is a desert with minimal surface features such as mountains or other major geological feautures, a low cost is realistic. However, due to a lack of experience in the industry, a conservative mode of \\$500,000 was chosen. The time spent on this stage is not factored into the overall project duration as it is only after this stage that the commitment to drilling the exploratory well is taken. Before this decision is made, the following models would need to be re-run with the actual cost of the initial study included."

    "### Exploratory Well Drilling\n",
    "With an idea of the probability of not finding oil, the time and cost of drilling the first well to test the underground reserves that are hopefully found. While the inital stages of off-shore exploration are significantly cheaper than onshore, the drilling cost can be orders of magnitude more expensive. Both methods use a similar amount of time, but the nature of deep see, and even shallow water operations make them far more costly. As oil companies as well as E&P firms rarely own their own drilling platforms, the service must be contracted out to specialized firms.\n",
    "The cost of these operations vary according to two major factors: the time it takes to drill and the depth of the hole.\n",
    "> Some 70-75% of the drilling costs are proportional to the duration of the drilling ... Only 25-30% pf the drilling costs acan therefore be estimated with a reasonable degree of precision. These are the costs which depend on the depth drilled(essentially the casing), the cost of the wellhead, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above statement, estimating the days required as well as the depth and other known costs seems to be an effective way to analyze the cost of the well. Contracts for drilling are generally quoted on a *dayrate*, but infrequently there are contracts for a fixed value granted.\n",
    "\n",
    "*First draft note*: I found liturature on the JAS and MRI models of drilling price estimation (after completing this section), which seems to be superior to what I used. I will apply this model and compare it to mine in the final draft.  It's based on a regression with known independent variables and dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drilling Time\n",
    "Estimations of onshore drilling have a range of 20 days to 120 days based on examining multiple sources. This variablity is often due to geographical challenges and hazards as well as somewhat frequent delays that occur. As Texas, specifically West and North Texas where oil is relatively abundant, there are not major geographical or geological challenges. Due to this, a normal distribution with $\\mu = 60\\  days,\\ \\sigma = 7\\ days$ was chosen. The assumption that projects that do not face significant delays have a 95.45% chance of being completed +/- two weeks of the 60 day estimate seems reasonable based on emperical evidence.<br><br>\n",
    "However, as there are \"frequent\" delays, a number that is not explicitly quantified in any of the literature reviewed, this must be taken into account. Based on capital budgeting projects from other industries, the assumed frequency of significant delays (exceeding the included two week margin) is assumed at 15% of projects. In the case of a delay, a duration of three to six weeks is chosen uniformly due to the number of possible issues that could lead to an unpredictable range of delays."

    "#### Drilling Depth\n",
    "There are a few quantitative models for estimating drilling depth based on a number of geological factors. However, rather than crudely estimating these paramteres, forecasting the average drilling depth in the United States for exploratory Oil wells based on the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports seemed more prudent. With either industry data or experimental results, using geological simulation would very likely result in a more accurate outcome.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The EIA provides average well depths for a number of parameters including the type of resource such as oil, natural gass, etc., as well as the three types of wells: dry, exploratory, and development. Last updated in August 2015, data from 1949 to 2008 is provided. A simple linear regression of the coded year, 1-60 rather than 1949-2008, as the independent variable with the depth of wells as the dependent variable yields a strong explanatory model. With an $R^2$ value of 83.79% and P-Values significant at $\\alpha = 0.05$ for both the slope and intercept, the least squares regression appears to be a strong fit. This equation was then used to forecast for well depth in the year 2016, the estimated completion year of the Texas project.\n",

    "Despite the safety advanced in the industry, oilfield engineering and services remain as some of the most dangerous jobs in America. This is due to hazardous machinery, working conditions, and the chance of blowouts. The probability of a blowout must be included in the model as they do occur with some frequency. The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board provides the frequency of onshore drilling blowouts as $4.9 \\times 10^{-4}$ per well drilled. This includes both exploratory and development wells. As this is not a development well and there is no oil being extracted, the cost would be related to equipment damage and perosnal injury. Due to this, a uniform distribution from \\$1-$10 million was chosen. This number is low as the contracting out of the drilling limits the liability exposure of the oil producing firm."

    "There is an ongoing economic debate about whether the build in prices from 2004 to 2014 was irrational, and the price drop in late 2014 is the return to rational prices. Due to the recent nature of the price drop and the lack of literature on the current state of the asset, I will be using a geometric random walk to simulate the price process of crude oil during the production phase. Arguments exist for both mean reverting and random walk models for oil, however the current situation calls for consvertism in forecasting. This is why a geometric random walk was chosen rather than a mean reverting process.\n",

This model assumes that oil is only produced and sold during trading days, not Saturday or Sunday. To add this would simply involve duplicating Friday values for the following two periods. Additionally it assumes that produced crude is being sold at closing prices, not intraday prices."
